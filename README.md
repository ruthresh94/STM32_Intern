Gained hands-on experience with Intel 8051 and STM32F407VGT6 microcontrollers during the Advanced Embedded System Design and RTOS training (ARM Cortex-M4). Developed and debugged embedded applications using Bare Metal Coding, HAL Library, and FreeRTOS, while enhancing proficiency in hardware-level interfacing and real-time operating systems. The tasks provided during the internship were shared as PDFs and images.
